Due to a custom Android SDK installation location I also had to set an extra environment variable:   

Command: ANDROID_HOME: C:\path\to\AndroidSDK    

Step 2: Configure an Android Virtual Device  

Set up Android Studio

Create an empty Android Studio project
Create an Android Virtual Device: Manage AVD → Create   
Boot your Android Virtual Device

Step 3: Jump into Command Line  

Open command prompt, jump into bash, and navigate to where you want your project to live
bash
cd /path/to/code  
Install React Native globally:
npm install -g react-native-cli

Create a new React Native project (Note: this step may take a while):   

react-native init AwesomeProject

CD into your new project
Optional: Configure Gradle Daemon for faster compiling:
((if not exist “%USERPROFILE%/.gradle” mkdir “%USERPROFILE%/.gradle”) && (echo org.gradle.daemon=true >> “%USERPROFILE%/.gradle/gradle.properties”))
Change your android/app/build.gradle file to use your installed version of Android SDK (I had to change mine from 23.0.1 to 23.0.3)
Start your application
react-native run-android
